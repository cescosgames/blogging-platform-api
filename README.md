# blogging platform API assignment

[Project from roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/blogging-platform-api)

## the goals are
- understand what restful apis are
- learn how to create a restful api
- learn about GET POST PUT PATCH and DELETE
- learn about status codes and error handling in APIs
- learn how to perform CRUD operations using an API
- learn how to work with databases

## initial notes
Feels like I learned a lot of this stuff already with the last blog assignment EXCEPT for working with remote databases. The recommendation here was to use 
MongoDB so I think it's about time I learn. 

## Gameplan
1. Set up the blog
- Since I already have done this, with full CRUD operations, I will REDO this but without saving locally, instead I will not save any information until the DB step
- example blog posts for setup will be in public/exPosts/post*x*.json
2. Set up the database
- Brand new, need to learn!
